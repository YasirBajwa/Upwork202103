PREREQUISITES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
You only need Visual Stuide Code

BACKGROUND
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This development environment is setup so that components can be developed 
independently and then later merged into our project.

It uses an in-browser Babel transformer so that Typescript, TSX and React can be used seamlessly.

It also uses a light-weight Sass-module that allows you to use a limited set of Sass.

Donâ€™t worry if this sounds complicated. Everything happens behind the scenes and you only have to 
focus on writing Html and CSS.

SETUP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clone https://github.com/rickevry/Upwork202103.git to your local computer
Open Visual Studio Code 
File -> Open Folder ./Upwork202103/PM-328
Install Live Server (Command Palette -> Install extensions -> Live server)
Click Go Live (bottom right in VS Code)
Open Chrome/Edge/Firefox and load http://127.0.0.1:5500/
Start working on ./src/Component1.tsx and ./src/Component1.scss

RULES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Do not make changes to global elements like root, body, span, div. Your css must 
  live inside your component only.

* Write html in Component1.tsx and Component1.scss

REQUIREMENTS
